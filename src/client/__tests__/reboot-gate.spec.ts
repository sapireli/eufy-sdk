/**
 * Which serials `reboot` restarts.
 *
 * `RESTART_HUB` goes out on the station's broadcast channel, so it restarts whatever owns the P2P
 * session. A HomeBase and a standalone camera each own theirs; a camera attached to a HomeBase does
 * not, and restarting it would restart the base — so that serial must throw, as must a non-camera one.
 * The station key resolves through the real router from the seeded registry; only the context build
 * and the send are stubbed.
