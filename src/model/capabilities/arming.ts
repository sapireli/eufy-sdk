   * see `AlarmDelayConfig`'s field docs.

   * 1255 reply. The T8010 reports each table on its own params, Home on 1157 and Away on 1158, and the

   * The alarm ids carry a static `phase` so one event name covers the whole lifecycle, the same shape
   * `battery` uses for its threshold pushes. The mode-switch push is known to identify WHICH mode and
   * what triggered the change, but neither has been observed on the wire here, so this emits the bare
   * transition and refreshes the `mode` read rather than trusting a decoded field.
