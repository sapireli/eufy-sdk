/**
 * A HomeBase-attached camera's media start has no level-1 wire.
 *
 * `sendMediaPayloadLevel2` returns without sending when there is no level-2 key, so on a connection whose
 * negotiation settled without one, every attached start is a no-op: nothing reaches the station, nothing
 * reports it, and the warm-up re-issues on a two-second interval until it times out. Observed on a real
 * account as 48 attached starts, all with no key, one keyframe between them and a `source-error` at the end —
 * where the retry that followed rebuilt the session, negotiated a key at once, and streamed in 0.69 s.
 *
 * An own-session camera is unaffected: `sendStartLiveOwnSession` carries both levels and picks by the key it
 * holds, which is why the hardening is on the attached path alone.
 *
 * The silence is the second half of the defect. A command that was never put on the wire has to say so, or
 * it is indistinguishable from one the station ignored — which is what made 48 of them invisible.
