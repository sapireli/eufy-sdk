/**
 * A session knows whether its path is answering, because the protocol already tells it and nothing read it.
 *
 * The heartbeat sends a PING every 5 s for the life of the connection and the station answers PONG, which is
 * kept only to echo its payload into the next PING. No timestamp, no deadline: a session pings into a path
 * that has stopped answering and cannot tell.
 *
 * What finally tells it is a media start abandoned unacknowledged — three seconds AFTER a caller asked for
 * video. Measured on a wired camera: a session idle for 18 s, resumed, twenty byte-identical retransmits with
 * no acknowledgement, and a rebuilt session streaming at once. Seven seconds of black screen, of which three
 * were spent discovering what an unanswered PONG had already established.
 *
 * Silence is only evidence where an answer was once given. A station that has never ponged says nothing about
 * itself by not ponging now, and treating that as death would rebuild its session forever.
