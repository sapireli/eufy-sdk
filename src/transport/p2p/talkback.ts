/**
 * Managed talkback session over P2P — the send-side twin of `live-stream.ts`. Takes audio from a host in
 * the codec the camera's speaker plays (AAC-LC ADTS, or raw AAC-ELD access units), recovers frame
 * boundaries, and paces the frames onto the wire at their own playback rate, bracketed by the device's
 * start/stop control frames.
 *
 * Pacing is the reason this exists rather than a bare `sendAudioFrame` loop. Each AAC-LC frame at
 * 16 kHz is 1024 samples — exactly 64 ms of audio — and each AAC-ELD access unit is 512 samples, 32 ms.
 * The device plays what arrives when it arrives.
 * A host piping a file would otherwise deliver a minute of audio in a few hundred milliseconds and
 * lose all but the tail. A live source paces itself and simply keeps the queue near-empty.
 *
 * The pacer is **wall-clock**, not tick-counted: a timer callback that runs late releases every frame
 * it owes rather than one. Releasing one per tick loses each late tick permanently, which measures as a
 * feed slower than realtime on a loaded event loop — and this feature attaches to a shared live source,
 * so muxing video on the same loop is the normal case, not the edge case.
